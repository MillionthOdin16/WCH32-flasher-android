# WCH32 Flasher Android

An Android application for flashing WCH32 family microcontrollers via USB using the Android USB Host API. This app is based on the [wchisp](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp) tool and provides a mobile solution for programming CH32 chips.

## Features

- **USB ISP Support**: Flash CH32 chips via USB using Android USB Host API
- **UART ISP Support**: Flash via USB-to-serial adapters (planned)
- **Multiple Firmware Formats**: Support for .bin, .hex, and .elf files
- **Real-time Progress**: Live flashing progress and logging
- **Chip Identification**: Automatic detection of connected CH32 chips
- **Device Compatibility**: Works with Android 3.1+ (API Level 12+)

## Supported Devices

This app supports WCH32 chips that are compatible with the wchisp tool:

- CH32V307 series
- CH32V103 series  
- CH32F103 series
- CH549, CH552 series
- CH582, CH573, CH579, CH592 series
- CH559 series
- CH32V203 series
- CH32V003 series
- CH32X035 series
- And more...

## Hardware Requirements

- Android device with USB Host support (Android 3.1+)
- USB OTG cable/adapter
- Supported WCH32 development board or chip in bootloader mode

## Software Architecture

### Android Layer
- **Kotlin/Java UI**: Material Design 3 interface with real-time logging
- **USB Host API**: Native Android USB device communication
- **JNI Bridge**: Interface between Java and native Rust code

### Native Layer (Rust)
- **wchisp Core**: Adapted from the official wchisp tool
- **Android USB Transport**: Custom transport layer replacing libusb
- **Protocol Implementation**: WCH ISP protocol handling
- **Device Database**: Chip definitions and configurations

## Building

### Prerequisites

1. **Android Studio** with Android SDK
2. **Rust toolchain** with Android targets:
   ```bash
   # Install Rust if not already installed
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
   # Add Android targets
   rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
   
   # Install cargo-ndk
   cargo install cargo-ndk
   ```

3. **Android NDK** (installed via Android Studio SDK Manager)

### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MillionthOdin16/WCH32-flasher-android.git
   cd WCH32-flasher-android
   ```

2. **Build native library**:
   ```bash
   ./build-native.sh
   ```

3. **Build Android app**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

   Or open in Android Studio and build normally.

## Usage

1. **Install the app** on your Android device
2. **Connect WCH32 device** via USB OTG cable
3. **Grant USB permissions** when prompted
4. **Select firmware file** (.bin, .hex, or .elf)
5. **Flash firmware** using the Flash button

### File Selection
The app supports firmware files in multiple formats:
- **Binary (.bin)**: Raw binary firmware
- **Intel HEX (.hex)**: Text-based hex format
- **ELF (.elf)**: Executable and Linkable Format

### Logging
Real-time logging shows:
- Device connection status
- Chip identification
- Flash progress
- Error messages and troubleshooting info
